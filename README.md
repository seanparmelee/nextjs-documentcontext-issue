This is a slightly modified version of the [styled-jsx-with-csp](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/styled-jsx-with-csp) example NextJS app. It was modified to use TypeScript to demonstrate an issue with the `DocumentContext` type in `_document.tsx`. This issue can be seen by running `npm run build`.
